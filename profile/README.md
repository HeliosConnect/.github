# Helios Connect

## Description

Helios Connect is a cross-chain verification dApp that enables users to create a single, provable identity spanning multiple blockchains. Born out of the Helios Collabathon, a 10-day event in September 2024, the Helios Connect MVP allows seamless integration of MultiversX and Injective wallets to create a unified cross-chain identity.

Our mission is to empower a range of integrated cross-chain use cases, including KYC, cross-chain DAOs and governance, direct marketing, and more. The code is open-source, fully documented, and intended to inspire greater cross-chain connectivity and interoperability across the industry.

## Problem Statement

The cross-chain user experience is fragmented, lacking a unified identity framework. With 617 million identity-verified crypto users, individuals must undergo multiple identity checks on each blockchain, making it difficult to securely link wallet ownership to their identity and track interactions trustlessly across chains.

Commercially, companies struggle to define, understand, and interact with their users, as each new wallet is often treated as a unique user. This conflates wallet and user statistics, inflating user numbers and complicating industry growth analysis. Helios Connect aims to create a user-centric framework where 1 user truly means 1 identity, enabling more accurate data and insights. Combined with KYC integrations and advancing cross-chain tokenization, Helios Connect could become a transformative tool for blockchain and Web3.

## Solution

Helios Connect provides single, provable Web3 identities within seconds, addressing user and cross-chain fragmentation by shifting from a wallet-centric to a user-centric approach. Our goal is to ensure that user statistics are accurate, with "1 user" meaning exactly thatâ€”no conflated or inflated data.

Helios Connect allows users to seamlessly prove ownership across multiple cross-chain wallets, creating opportunities for integrated cross-chain use cases. This includes areas such as DAOs and governance, KYC, cross-chain communities, cross-chain tokenization, and direct marketing. By unifying user identity, Helios Connect paves the way for greater interoperability and innovation across the blockchain ecosystem.
